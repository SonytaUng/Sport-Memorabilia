pPlease cd into this directory first ("../frontend/test/"). To run my python script, you will need python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pipenv. 
To install pipenv, please do pip install pipenv (If you don't have pip, please install.). Pipenv creates
a virtual environment so that you don't have to install the required python modules to your local system.
After you have install pipenv, please do "pipenv install" and "pipenv shell" to start the VM. Also, 
I am using Chrome Web Driver, so please make sure you have the lastest version of Chrome (at least 94v). 
You don't have to add the web driver to your path. To run the script, just do "python UL_test.py".
